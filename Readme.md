# Threax/Snapraid
This is an image of [Snapraid](https://www.snapraid.it/) 11.6. It includes the source code from the release, since the [git](https://github.com/amadvance/snapraid/) repo does not seem to have the configure file.

# Building
To build run Build.ps1

# Running
Mount your disks as volumes along with the config. Then supply the snapraid command you want to run like `sync` or `scrub`.
