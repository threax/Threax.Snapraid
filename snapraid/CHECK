SnapRAID CHECK
==============

The regression test of SnapRAID is run using the command:

	make check

You can also run the regression test in valgrind with:

	./configure --enable-valgrind
	make check

To run a coverage test you should use:

	./configure --enable-coverage
	make lcov_reset
	make check
	make lcov_capture
	make lcov_html

and open the file ./cov/index.html in your browser to see the results.

Please note that in the coverage analysis we exclude the handling of all
the error conditions that result in an immediate termination of the program.
You can recognize this excluded code because it's enclosed between
the LCOV_EXCL_START and LCOV_EXCL_STOP keywords.

To test with the clang static analyzer use:

	scan-build ./configure
	scan-build make
